## Edit the theme

If you want to do docs-related theme changes, the simplest way is to have both `fixit-docs` and `FixIt` cloned as sibling directories, and then run:

```bash
HUGO_MODULE_WORKSPACE=hugo.work hugo server --ignoreVendorPaths "**"
```

Finally, create a new pull request at <https://github.com/hugo-fixit/docs/pulls> to submit your contribution ðŸŽ‰
