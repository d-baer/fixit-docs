## What is CSE?

**Custom Search Engine** (CSE) lets you create a search engine for your website, your blog, or a collection of websites. You can configure your search engine to search both web pages and images. You can fine-tune the ranking, customize the look and feel of the search results etc.

Common search engines have their own CSE services, such as:

- [Google Programmable Search Engine][google-cse]
- [Bing Custom Search][bing-cse]

## Configure CSE in FixIt

{{< version 0.3.16 >}}

First, manually create a search result display page:

```bash
hugo new content search/index.md
```

To configure Google or Bing CSE in the FixIt theme:

```toml
[params]
  [params.search]
    enable = true
    type = "cse"
  [params.cse]
    # Search engine: ["google", "bing"]
    engine = "google"
    resultsPage = "/search/"
    [params.cse.google]
      cx = ""
    [params.cse.bing]
      # Unsupported yet
```

## Google CSE

Google CSE, also known as Google Programmable Search Engine, this section mainly introduces how to use Google CSE in FixIt. You can go to [Programmable Search Engine Tutorial][google-cse-tutorial] page to view the complete tutorial.

    type: info
  - content: "Paste the search engine ID into the `cx` field in the configuration file."

```
